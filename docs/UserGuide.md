## Quick start

1. Ensure you have **Java 11** installed in your Computer.
   * The method to check the Java version you use will be different for every operating system. 
     * **Windows** users: <br>
     Click on the '**Windows**' key and search for '**Command Prompt**' <br> 
     * **Mac** users: <br> 
     Click on '**F4**' and search for '**Terminal**'
     * **Linux** users: <br>
     Click on '**Ctrl**' + '**Alt**' + '**T**' keys simultaneously
   * Once the application is open, type `java -version` and hit '**Enter/ Return**'. 
   * The application should state your Java version, as shown in the red circle below:
     <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
        <img src="images/javaVersion.png" alt="javaVersion" width="600"/> 
     </div>
    
    * If you do not see `11`, or if you do not have Java installed, follow the instructions [here](https://www.codejava.net/java-se/download-and-install-java-11-openjdk-and-oracle-jdk.) to download **Java 11**. 
    
2. Download the latest `NUSCoursemates.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/releases).
     <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
        <img src="images/jarDownload.png" alt="jarDownload" width="600"/> 
     </div>  
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_, such as the **Desktop** folder, for your NUSCoursemates. 
4. Open the command terminal in Step 1.
5. `cd` into the folder with the `NUSCoursemates.jar` file. For example, if your file is in the **Desktop** folder, simply type `cd Desktop`. 
6. Enter the next command, `java -jar NUSCoursemates.jar`. Your commands should look like this:
     <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
        <img src="images/ChangeDirectory.png" alt="Change Directory" width="600"/>  
     </div>  
7. Hit '**Enter**'. An interface similar to the image below should appear:
     <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
        <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Ui"/>
     </div>
8. **Absolutely well done!** You are now ready to move on to the next section to learn about the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#using-the-command-line-interface--cli-).

## Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)  
**NUSCoursemates** uses the Command Line Interface (CLI). CLI is a means of interacting with a computer program that runs on **text-based inputs** to execute different tasks. 

Do not worry! CLI is definitely less scary than it sounds. In fact, this is all there is to it: 

<img src="images/CommandResult.png" alt="CommandResult"/>

Recall that the image above shows the [Command Box](#2-command-box) of **NUSCoursemates**. It is the _heart_ of **NUSCoursemates**. 

Therefore, it is no surprise that you will be keying in commands, which are text-based inputs, in the [Command Box](#2-command-box) to execute different tasks. 

While we know that you cannot wait to try out some new commands, let us first learn what a command consists of:

 <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
    <img src="images/CommandFormat2.png" alt="Command Format" width="650"/>
 </div>

A command is made up of multiple components: 

| Component    | Example    | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Command Word | `add`      | Specifies the task to be performed                                                                                                                              |
| Prefix       | `n/`       | Indicates the field to be edited (e.g., name)                                                                                                                   |
| Field        | `John Doe` | Represents the updated value or content. <br/> These values, which are provided by the user, are used to replace the `UPPER_CASE` letters in the command format |

Additionally, certain symbols in the command format are used to indicate additional properties.
For example (with reference to the `add` command above): 

| Prefix/Field Format | Example             | Description                                                                         |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `n/NAME`            | `n/John Doe`        | Denotes a compulsory `name` field                                                   |
| `[e/EMAIL]`         | `e/johnd@gmail.com` | Denotes an optional `email` field with a maximum of one email for the student       |
| `[t/TAG]…​`         | `t/friend`          | Denotes an optional `tag` field with no limit on the number of tags for the student |

Let us look at an example for the `add` command:
 <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
    <img src="images/CommandFormat.png" alt="Command Format Example" width="650"/>
 </div>

When adding your new connections, you would modify the fields accordingly. Note that the command words and prefixes are case-sensitive, and their spelling must be accurate. 

Now that you have learnt about the components of a command, you are ready to use our application! Admittedly, we are as excited as you are! 

You could try typing one of the following commands in the command box. Afterwards, press **'Enter'** to see the magic happen!

* `list` : Lists all contacts.

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/15 Computing Ave, #01-01 c/cs2101` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

* `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

**Great job!** You are now ready to learn about the exciting [features](#features) we have designed for you. Enjoy!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about CLI:**<br>
* As a SoC student, you will encounter the CLI in some SoC courses.
* It is beneficial for you to start learning the CLI early!

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* You can include any number of tags or courses (including none).
* Only three tag types are allowed: 'Friend,' 'Close Friend,' and 'Emergency.'
* To add a 'Close Friend' tag, use t/cf (case-insensitive).
* Tags and Courses are case-insensitive when entered.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Caution:** <br>
* A student **MUST** have a name and phone number. <br>
* Duplicate students are identified by their names; ensure the name is unique. <br>
* Make sure the courses you add exist and are valid. <br>

* `add n/Tom Lee p/81289900`

### Editing a student : `edit`

Picture this: your best friend has changed his phone number, and you want to ensure his details are updated. With the "edit" feature, modifying any of your contact's details is a piece of cake.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [th/TELEHANDLE] [t/TAG]…​ [c/add-COURSE_TO_ADD]…​ 
[c/del-COURSE_TO_DELETE]…​ [c/ORIGINAL_COURSE-NEW_COURSE]…​`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Caution:** <br>
* Although it is very convenient to be able to chain together multiple types of modifications, please be mindful when trying to delete or change a course even though the specified student does not possess it.<br>
* For example, if Student 1 has `CS2103T`, and you perform `edit 1 c/del-CS2103T c/del-CS2103T`, while the first delete is valid, the second delete is not - because you are trying to remove a course that no longer exists for Student 1.<br> 
* An error message will be displayed if such errors occur and all changes in the chain of modifications will not be performed if any one of them are deemed to be invalid. 
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Pro Tip:**<br>
* You can include `t/` in your edit command to remove all of a person's tags.
* You can include `c/` your edit command to remove all of a peron's courses.
</div>

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com c/add-MA1521 c/del-CS2103T c/MA2001-ST2334`. This command is targeted at the first person in the address book, which as seen in the "Before" picture below, is John. 
  * This command edits his phone number and email address to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively, and performs the following course modifications in order - add MA1521, delete CS2103T (valid because John has CS2103T), change MA2001 to ST2334 (valid because John has MA2001). John now has courses MA1521 and ST2334, as shown in "After" below. 

Before:

After:

* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of Person 2 to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Deleting a student : `delete`

> "It's really amazing when two strangers become the best of friends, but it's really sad when the best of friends become two strangers."
> — Unknown

In your journey with NUSCoursemates, you may find it necessary to part ways with a student entry in your address book. Maybe a friend has graduated or you've made an error. Whatever the reason, the delete command is your tool for decluttering and maintaining a neat address book.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* `INDEX`: Deletes the student at the specified mark.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* The deleted student will no longer appear when the `findcourse`, `findstudent` or `list` commands are entered.
</div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

## Viewing Student Profiles
In NUSCoursemates, your journey begins with exploring student profiles. Our user-centric approach puts you in control, making it a breeze to view and connect with your fellow students. 

Let's delve into the specifics of how to effortlessly access and make the most of student profiles.

### Listing all students : `list`

Discover the power of the "List" feature – your ultimate tool for staying organized and in the know about your student contacts. It's like having your address book at your fingertips, ready to provide you with a clear, comprehensive view of your network.

**How to do it:** With the straightforward `list` command, you can effortlessly generate a list of all the students in your address book. It's as simple as typing "list."

Format: `list`

Examples:
![list](images/ListFeature.png)

### Locating students by name: `findstudent`

Finds students whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `findstudent KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `findstudent John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `findstudent alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'findstudent alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

### Discover Coursemates with `findcourse`

Ever wondered who in your address book has taken the same courses as you? With `findcourse`, you can effortlessly locate fellow NUS SoC students you've saved who have enrolled in specific courses.


Here’s how to make the most of this handy tool:

Format: `findcourse KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`
* Case-Insensitive: Type in any case, like 'cs2030s' or 'CS2030S', and we'll find a match.
* Search By Course Names: This tool zeroes in on the course names associated with your contacts, giving you precise results.
* Partial Words Are Okay: Entering 'CS2030' will identify students who have taken both 'CS2030' and 'CS2030S'.
* Multiple Course Searches: Use multiple keywords, and we'll show you students enrolled in any of the related courses. For instance, entering 'cs2100 ma1521' will reveal students who took either 'CS2100', 'MA1521', or both.


Examples:
* `findcourse cs2030s` returns `CS2030` and `CS2030S`
* `findcourse cs2100 ma1521` returns `CS2100` and `MA1521`

  ![result for 'findcourse CS2100 MA1521'](images/FindcourseCS2100MA1521.png)

### Sorting by Course: `sort course`

Picture this: Your NUS address book is teeming with contacts, each with their unique set of courses. Curious about who's taken on the most courses or who's just starting out?

At its core, the `sort course` command rearranges your address book, bringing those with the most courses to the forefront in **descending order**.

For a twist in perspective, and to cheer on those just embarking on their academic journey, use `size-ascending`. This flips the narrative, showcasing contacts with fewer courses in **ascending** order.

#### Format: `sort course`
* Revel in the contacts who've ventured into many courses, displayed in **descending order**.

Example:
Before Sorting:
![initial](images/BeforeSorting.png)

After `sort course`:
![sourse_course](images/SortCourse.png)

#### Format: `sort course size-ascending`
* Highlight the newcomers, those with the fewest courses, arranged in ascending order.

Example:
Before Sorting:
![initial](images/BeforeSorting.png)

After `sort course size-ascending`:
![sort_course_size_ascending](images/SortCourseAscending.png)


### Sorting by Name: `sort name`
As time passes, you might encounter students with incredibly hard-to-spell names. You might vaguely recall the first letter of the name but struggle to spell it out completely.

Here's the good news: The sort name command neatly **arranges the students** in your address book **by their names**, making it easier than ever to look up a student.

Plus, you have the flexibility to specify whether you would like to sort their names in **ascending** or **descending** lexicographic order.

Format: `sort name-SORT_CRITERION`

Examples:
* `sort name-descending` sorts students by their names in lexicographical descending order.
* `sort name` or `sort name-ascending` sorts students by their names in lexicographical ascending order.


### Sorting by Tags: `sort tags`
The greatest joy in university is, without a doubt, to attend boring classes with your close friends.

With the `sort tags` command, NUSCoursemates helps you keep a _close_ track of students tagged as 'Close Friend' by placing them right at the top of the address book.

These will be followed by students tagged as 'Friend', and 'Emergency', in that order of decreasing importance.

Format: `sort tags`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note on students with multiple tags:**<br>
Students with multiple tags will be sorted by the tag with the greatest importance.  
For example, a student with both 'Friend' and 'Emergency' tags will be placed in the address book with other students tagged as 'Friend'
</div>

## Clearing Student Profiles

In NUSCoursemates, we understand the need for flexibility and ease when it comes to managing your student profiles. Clearing profiles should be a straightforward process, and we've designed it to be just that. Let's explore how you can effortlessly clear profiles when necessary.
