NUSCourseMates is a **desktop app for managing contacts and their courses, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NUSCourseMates can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `NUSCourseMates.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your NUSCourseMates.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar NUSCourseMates.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>


### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [th/TELEHANDLE] [t/TAG]… [c/COURSE]…​`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

* A person MUST have a name and phone number

* A person can have any number of tags or courses (including 0)

* Only unique students can be added. It is considered a duplicate if an existing students and the current students to be added have name.

* Courses added have to be existing and valid courses.

</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/81234567 e/John@gmail.com a/123 NUS Rd th/@johnny t/close_friend c/CS1231S c/CS2103T`
* `add n/Bob Lee p/91234567 e/BL@gmail.com a/123 Clementi Rd th/@boblee c/CS2030S c/CS2040S c/GEA1000 c/NUR1113a`
* `add n/Tom Lee p/81289900`

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book.

Format: `list`

Examples:
![list](images/List.png)


### Editing a student : `edit`

Edits an existing student in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [th/TELEHANDLE] [t/TAG]…​ [c/COURSE_TO_CHANGE-CHANGED_COURSE]…​`

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.
* If a student is not already taking COURSE_TO_CHANGE, the specified change will be ignored. Only those courses that are actually taken by the specified student will be modified.
* The changes will be performed in the listed order.
  * Assuming a specified student takes MA1521 initially:
    * If the successive changes applied are MA1521-CS2100 and CS2100-MA1521, then MA1521 is still associated with the student.
    * If the successive changes applied are MA1521-CS2103 and MA1521-CS2100, then MA1521 will be changed to CS2103 and not CS2100.
* Editing a course will not result in duplicates. For example, CS2103T-MA1521 and CS2100-MA1521 will remove both CS2103T and CS2100, and create only one copy of MA1521.


Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com c/MA1521-ST2334 CS2100-CS2106` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively, and changes the MA1521 and CS2100 courses to ST2334 and CS2106 respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Saving the data

NUSCourseMates data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

NUSCourseMates data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NUSCourseMates will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous NUSCourseMates home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
