### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

#### 3.2.1 List Panel

In the UI of the `MainWindow`, three major List Panels—`PersonListPanel`, `CourseListPanel`, and `TagListPanel`—implement the Observer Design Pattern using the `ObservableList` class. 
Each panel observes changes in its associated data, enabling dynamic updates in response to modifications. 

For instance, the `CourseListPanel`, observing the `ObservableList<Pair<String, Integer>>`, triggers updates to the `CourseListCard` upon any changes in the courses.
This implementation is replicated for `PersonListPanel` and `TagListPanel`. 

The following class diagram illustrates the relationships:

![Panel Class Diagram](images/PanelClassDiagram.png)

### 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 3.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores NUSCoursemates data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### 3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both NUSCoursemates data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **4. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Add Course feature

#### 4.1.1 Implementation
The add course mechanism is facilitated by `AddCommand`. It extends `Command` which overrides the following operation:
* `AddCommand#execute():` Adds a person into NUSCoursemates

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step focusing on the `Course` field.

Step 1. The user executes `add n/John p/81234567 c/CS2103T` to add a new person.

Step 2. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the command, it will pass it to an `AddressBookParser` object which will call `parseCommand()` which creates a parser `AddCommandParser` object.

Step 3. The parser `AddCommandParser` will then parse the command and create objects for each field. The course will be indicated by the `c/` prefix.

Step 4. Using all the parsed fields (`Name, Phone, Email, Address, Telehandle, Tag, Courses`), a `Person` object is constructed.

Step 5. This results in a `AddCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.

Step 6. The command will communicate with the `Model` to add a person. 

Step 7. Upon success, the result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is returned back from `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** 
* The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
* During the `AddCommandParser`, `Name, Phone, Email, Address, Telehandle, Tag` objects are created as well but due to space constraint and simplification, the details have been omitted
* There are other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command and can be found [here](#33-logic-component) 
</div>

The following activity diagram shows how the add operation works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

#### 4.1.2 Design considerations:
**Aspect: Adding Courses to PersonList**
* **Alternative 1:** Create a new command specifically for adding courses to person records (e.g., "AddCourseCommand"). 
  * Pros: Offers a clear separation of concerns and commands, potentially reducing complexity. 
  * Cons: Introduces an additional command class, which might require extra development time.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Reuse the existing "AddCommand" by adding a 'c/' prefix to specify course addition. 
  * Pros: Minimizes the need for creating new command classes, thus reducing code duplication. 
  * Cons: Slightly alters the behavior of the existing "AddCommand," which may increase complexity and potentially confuse users.

### 4.2 Edit feature

#### 4.2.1 Implementation

The edit person mechanism is facilitated by `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit behaves at each step.

Step 1. An existing user launches the application and the second person listed in NUSCoursemates is John, and one of the courses he has is `MA2001`.

Step 2. The user executes `edit 2 c/MA2001-MA1521` command to edit the second person's MA2001 course to MA1521 in NUSCoursemates. The `edit` command calls `LogicManager#execute()`. An `EditCommandParser` object is then created, and `EditCommandParser#parse` method is called on the object. `EditCommandParser#parse` makes sense of the arguments supplied by the user, where the types of arguments are distinguished by their prefixes.

Step 3. `ParserUtil#parseCourseChanges(courseChanges)` is called, which parses the list of course changes supplied 
for the second person. This method checks that the course changes are supplied in the correct format, and if so,
it checks that all the supplied courses within those course changes are valid.

Step 4. The `EditCommand` is created, and then executed by `EditCommand#execute`.

Step 5. `EditCommand#execute` calls the following methods from `Model`:
* `Model#hasPerson(editedPerson)` which checks if the address book contains a duplicate person (a person with the same name).
* `Model#setPerson(personToEdit, editedPerson)` replaces `personToEdit` with `editPerson`
* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` updates the address book list with the edited person.

Step 6. `EditCommand#execute` returns a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for EditCommandParser should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram. </div>

The following activity diagram sheds more light on how exactly the chain of edit operations work:

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

Here are some more notes for the activity diagram above:
* When parsing the list of course modifications, if any of the specified course are invalid (see earlier definition of what is considered a 'valid' course), then the end node is taken immediately.
* If the end node is taken before all courses in the list that the user passed, then no course modifications present earlier in the list will be performed at all, even if they are valid. 


#### 4.2.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: Performing course edits**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Retain the current c/ prefix in the edit command, but create additional sub-prefixes (i.e. c/add-, c/del-) after the c/ prefix.
    * Pros: A common edit interface which enables all types of course modifications to be executed all at once makes this a flexible and user-friendly solution. 
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each type of modification is correct, and ensure the changes are performed in the correct (listed) order.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a command for each type of modification, i.e. "addcourse" or "deletecourse".
    * Cons: Greatly reduced flexibility. Does not allow different types of modifications to be executed together at once, as each command can only handle one specific type of modification. There is also a lot more overhead, as three entirely new commands will have to be created, which leads to an arguably more bloated codebase.


### 4.3 Find Course feature

#### 4.3.1 Implementation  

The findcourse feature is facilitated by the FindCourseCommand class, which leverages a CourseContainsKeywordsPredicate object. This predicate object is responsible for checking if a person's course contains the specified keyword.
The following operations are central to this feature:

* `FindCourseCommand#execute(Model model)` —  Executes the command, updating the filtered person list in the model based on the criteria in the predicate.
* `CourseContainsKeywordsPredicate#test(Person person)` — Checks if the person's course matches the keyword criteria.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the findcourse mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user wants to filter the list of persons to show only those enrolled in the course "MA2001". They execute the command "findcourse MA2001".


Step 2. The `LogicManager` receives this command string and passes it to the `AddressBookParser`.


Step 3. The `AddressBookParser` identifies the type of command and invokes the `FindCourseCommandParser` to parse the course keyword.


Step 4. The `FindCourseCommandParser` creates a `CourseContainsKeywordsPredicate` object with the keyword "MA2001" and then creates a `FindCourseCommand` object with this predicate.


Step 5. The `FindCourseCommand` is executed, and it uses the predicate to filter the list of persons in the model. The filtered list in the model is updated to only show persons enrolled in "MA2001".


Step 6. The result, which is the number of persons listed, is then shown to the user.


The following sequence diagram shows how the `findcourse` operation works:

![FindcourseSequenceDiagram](images/FindcourseSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for FindCourseCommandParser should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `findcourse` command:

![FindcourseActivityDiagram](images/FindcourseActivityDiagram.png)

#### 4.3.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: How filter is done:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a predicate object (`CourseContainsKeywordsPredicate`) to handle filtering.
    * Pros: Modular approach. Easy to extend with more search features in the future. Decouples filtering logic from the command itself.
    * Cons: Might be over-engineered if no other search features are planned.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement filtering logic directly within the `FindCourseCommand`.
    * Pros: Simpler without the need for additional objects or classes.
    * Cons: Makes the command class more complex. Harder to extend with more search features in the future.

**Aspect: Case-sensitivity in search:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Case-insensitive search.
    * Pros: Offers flexibility and a better user experience. Users do not need to worry about the exact casing of course module IDs.
    * Cons: Might yield results that the user was not expecting if there are course module IDs with varied casing.

* **Alternative 2:** Case-sensitive search.
    * Pros: Precise search results based on exact casing.
    * Cons: Less flexible. Users need to input the exact casing of course module IDs.

### 4.4 Find Student feature

#### 4.4.1 Implementation

The `findstudent` feature is facilitated by the `FindCommand` class, which uses a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object. This predicate object is designed to check if a person's name matches any of the specified keywords.
The following operations are central to this feature:

* `FindCommand#execute(Model model)` —  Executes the command, updating the filtered person list in the model based on the criteria set by the predicate.
* `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate#test(Person person)` — Determines if the person's name matches any of the keyword criteria.


Outlined below is an example usage scenario and how the `findstudent` mechanism functions at each stage.

Step 1. The user aims to filter the list of persons to display only those whose names include "Alice" or "Bob". They input the command "findstudent alice bob".

Step 2. The `LogicManager` obtains this command string and forwards it to the `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. The `AddressBookParser` discerns the type of command and engages the `FindCommandParser` to parse the name keywords.

Step 4. The `FindCommandParser` constructs a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object with the keywords "Alice" and "Bob" and subsequently initiates a `FindCommand` object using this predicate.

Step 5. The `FindCommand` is then executed. Utilizing the predicate, it filters the list of persons in the model. The model's filtered list is updated to only show persons with names "Alice" or "Bob".

Step 6. The outcome, which indicates the number of persons found, is presented to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `findstudent` operation works:

![FindstudentSequenceDiagram](images/FindStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for FindCommandParser should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `findstudent` command:

![FindstudentActivityDiagram](images/FindstudentActivityDiagram.png)

#### 4.4.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: How filter is done:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a predicate object (`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`) to handle filtering.
    * Pros: Modular approach. Easy to extend with more search features in the future. Decouples filtering logic from the command itself.
    * Cons: Might be over-engineered if no other search features are planned.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement filtering logic directly within the `FindCommand`.
    * Pros: Simpler without the need for additional objects or classes.
    * Cons: Makes the command class more complex. Harder to extend with more search features in the future.

**Aspect: Case-sensitivity in search:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Case-insensitive search.
    * Pros: Offers flexibility and a better user experience. Users do not need to worry about the exact casing of student names.
    * Cons: Might yield results that the user was not expecting if there are student names with varied casing.

* **Alternative 2:** Case-sensitive search.
    * Pros: Precise search results based on exact casing.
    * Cons: Less flexible. Users need to input the exact casing of student names.

### 4.5 Sort feature

#### 4.5.1 Implementation
The sort feature sorts the students in the `UniquePersonList` object in `AddressBook` according to a specified sorting criterion.

The sorting mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommandParser` and `SortCommand`. The latter extends the existing `Command` class and implements the following method: 
* `SortCommand#execute()`: Executes the sort command and returns the result message 

After the user specifies the sorting criterion, the corresponding subclass of `PersonSorter` will be instantiated. There are different `PersonSorter` objects that each sorts differently. The `PersonSorter` object, which implements the Comparable interface, directly sorts the `UniquePersonList` object in `AddressBook`.

Format: `sort CRITERION`

There are 3 ways to sort the students in NUSCoursemates:

1. **Sort by Name**
    - Function: Sorts students by name in alphabetical order
    - Criterion: name, name-ascending, name-descending
    - Example usage: `sort name-ascending`

2. **Sort by Course size**
    - Function: Sorts students by the number of courses taken
    - Criterion: course, course size-ascending, course size-descending
    - Example usage: `sort course size-ascending`

3. **Sort by Tags**
    - Function: Sorts students by their tags
    - Criterion: tags
    - Example usage: `sort tags`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user will input `sort name`, where `sort` is the command word and `name` is a valid sort criterion.

Step 2. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the command, it will call `parseCommand()` of an `AddressBookParser` object which creates a `SortCommandParser` object.

Step 3. `SortCommandParser` will then parse the sort criterion, which in this case, is `name`.

Step 4. The `createPersonSorter()` method of the `PersonSorter` class is called along with the sort criterion. 

Step 5. A new `PersonNameAscendingSorter` object is constructed. 

Step 6. A new `SortCommand` object is constructed with the `PersonNameAscendingSorter` object created in the previous step. 

Step 7. The `SortCommand` object is then executed by the `LogicManager`.

Step 8. As a result, the `SortCommand` object will call `Model#sortPersonList()` with the `PersonNameAscendingSorter` object created in the earlier steps.  

The following UML Sequence diagram shows what happens when `sort name` is entered as an input up to this step.

![SortSequenceDiagram1](images/SortSequenceDiagram1.png) 

Step 9. Afterwards, `AddressBook#sortPersonList()` is called with the same `PersonNameAscendingSorter` object.

Step 10. Consequently, `UniquePersonList#sortPersons()` is called with the `PersonNameAscendingSorter` object that sorts the list. As a result, we get a list that is sorted according to the specified sort criterion. 

The following UML Sequence diagram shows what happens within the `Model` component. 

![SortSequenceDiagram2](images/SortSequenceDiagram2.png)  

Step 11. Finally, after the sorting process is successful, the result of the `sort` command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is returned back from Logic.

* The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following UML Activity diagram shows the workflow of sorting students in NUSCoursemates, based on different sorting criterion:
![SortActivityDiagram](images/SortActivityDiagram.png)

#### 4.5.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the sorted list should be stored.**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort the `UniquePersonList` object directly. This means that the original list will be modified as it is sorted. The resulting list is stored locally.

* Pros: Since the resulting list is stored locally, the user's preference is saved because he is able to see the same sorted list the next time he opens the application.
* Pros: Smaller memory usage because there is no need to store copies of the lists are stored.
* Cons: Potentially slower because the list is modified locally.

**Alternative 2:** Make a copy of the original list for sorting before saving it.

* Pros: Original list is recoverable in case of an error.
* Cons: More memory required to store copies of the original and sorted list.
* Cons: Less efficient as it takes time to copy the list.
* Cons: Prone to errors that may arise from the copying stage, as the list to be copied from and the list to be copied to will always change.

Ultimately, Alternative 1 is chosen over Alternative 2. Since the application is being used frequently, the user's preference should be saved so that he does not need to run the sort command again to see a sorted list.  
Moreover, there are checks and error handling to ensure that the `PersonSorter` objects are able to sort the list correctly.

### 4.6 Tag feature

#### 4.6.1 Implementation

The Tag feature is facilitated by the `Tag` class, which contains an attribute `TagType` to determine the type of tag. The creation and validation of tags are significantly associated with the `TagUtil` class.

* `TagUtil#canAddOrEditEmergencyTag(Person toAdd, List<Person> currentPersonList)` — Determines if a new "Emergency" tag can be added or edited based on existing contacts with the "Emergency" tag.
* `Tag#isEmergencyTag()` — Checks if a tag is of the type "Emergency".

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user wishes to add a new contact with a tag "Emergency". They execute the `add` command: add n/John Doe p/12345678 t/Emergency.

Step 2. The `LogicManager` receives this command string and passes it to the `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. The `AddressBookParser` identifies the type of command and invokes the relevant parser, in this case, `AddCommandParser`, to process the command details.

Step 4. The `AddCommandParser` processes the input, and if a tag is provided, a new `Tag` object is created.

Step 5. Before the `Person` object is created, the `TagUtil#canAddOrEditEmergencyTag()` method is called to ensure not more than two contacts have the "Emergency" tag.

Step 6. If the validation is successful, a new `Person` object is created with the provided details, including the tag, and added to the model. Otherwise, a CommandException is thrown, notifying the user of the error.

Step 7. The result, a successful addition or an error message, is displayed to the user.

The following class diagram shows the overview of the Tag mechanism.

![TagClassDiagram](images/TagClassDiagram.png)


The following sequence diagram shows how the Tag operation works by calling the `add` Command:

![TagSequenceDiagram](images/TagSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  
* For simplicity in the diagrams, all interactions with different components of the Logic are represented under a single 'Logic' participant.

</div>



The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `add` command; the `edit` command will be similar:

![TagActivityDiagram](images/TagActivityDiagram.png)

#### 4.6.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: Validation of the "Emergency" tag count:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a utility class (`TagUtil`) to check the constraints.
    * Pros: Modular approach. Decouples the tag validation logic from the command classes. Easier to maintain and extend if more constraints are introduced in the future.
    * Cons: Another layer of abstraction. Might be an overkill if no other tag constraints are planned.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement the validation logic within the `AddCommand` class.
    * Pros: Simpler approach without additional utility classes. Direct handling within the main command.
    * Cons: Makes the command class more complicated. Difficult to maintain and extend if more constraints on tags are added in the future.

**Aspect: Extensibility of tags:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use an enumeration (TagType) to define types of tags.
    * Pros: Clean and organized. Easy to add more types of tags in the future. Validation can be done based on enum values.
    * Cons: Might be restrictive if dynamic creation of new tag types is required in the future.

* **Alternative 2:** Store tag types as strings without an enumeration.
    * Pros: Dynamic creation of new tag types without changing the code.
    * Cons: Difficult to validate and handle specific tag types. Potential for typos and inconsistencies.

**Aspect:  Types and Limitations of Tags:**


* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Limit the system to three specific types of tags.
    * Pros: Ensures that the tags used are relevant to the application's main purpose, which is to manage coursemates' contact information.
    * Pros: Simplifies the interface and experience for the user, ensuring consistency.
    * Pros: Reduces clutter and potential misuse by preventing users from adding arbitrary tags
    * Cons: Users might find it restrictive if they wish to add more customized tags for further categorization.
    * Cons: Possible need for future extensions or adjustments if more relevant tag categories emerge.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to add any type of tags.
    * Pros: Provides flexibility for users to categorize their contacts as they see fit.
    * Pros: Avoids potential limitations, giving room for diverse usage scenarios.
    * Cons: Might deviate from the main purpose of the application, leading to inconsistent use.
    * Cons: Users might add unrelated or inappropriate tags, leading to clutter.

### 4.7 Telehandle feature
    
#### 4.7.1 Implementation

The Telehandle mechanism is facilitated by the `Telehandle` and `AddCommand` classes.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Telehandle` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user wishes to add a new contact with their desired `Telehandle`. They execute the `add` command: `add n/john p/98765432 th/@john2`.

Step 2. The `LogicManager` receives this command string and passes it to the `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. The `AddressBookParser` identifies the type of command and invokes the relevant parser, in this case, `AddCommandParser`, to process the command details.

Step 4. The parser `AddCommandParser` will then parse the command and create objects for each field. `Telehandle` will be indicated by the `th/` prefix.
For this scenario, we will be focusing on the `Telehandle`.

Step 5. The `AddCommandParser` processes the input and if a `Telehandle` is provided, the `ParserUtil#parseTelehandle()` method will then be invoked within `AddCommandParser`, else an empty `Telehandle` would be created instead.

Step 6. Using all the parsed fields (`Name, Phone, Email, Address, Telehandle, Tag, Courses`), a `Person` object is constructed.

Step 7. This results in a `AddCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.

Step 8. The command will communicate with the `Model` to add a person with the inputted `Telehandle`.

Step 9. Upon success, the result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is returned back from `Logic`.


The following sequence diagram shows how the `Telehandle` works through the `AddCommand`:

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source:**Note:**
* The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
* During the `AddCommandParser`, `Name, Phone, Email, Address, Tag, Course` objects are created as well but due to space constraint and simplification, the details have been omitted
* There are other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command and can be found [here](#33-logic-component)
</div>

The following object diagram below shows the new `Person` object created when the user executes the `Add` command with a valid `Telehandle`.

![TelehandleObjectDiagram](images/TelehandleObjectDiagram.png) 

#### 4.7.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: Input constraints in `Telehandle`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Requiring an @ sign in front of all `Telehandle` fields.
    * Pros: Increased clarity. The "@" sign provides a clear visual cue that the input is a `Telehandle`, helping users distinguish it from other fields such as `Address`.
    * Cons: Requiring an "@" sign may be unusual for users who are not familiar with social media or who have not encountered this format before. This requirement may feel counterintuitive to some.

* **Alternative 2:** Not requiring an @ sign in front of all `Telehandle` fields.
    * Pros: Offers flexibility and a better user experience. 
    * Cons: `Telehandle` fields that rely solely on user input may not differ significantly from other types of 
      user-provided data such as `Address` and `Email`. This may cause confusion to the users when viewing the details

### 4.8 Feedback feature

#### 4.8.1 Implementation

The Feedback mechanism is facilitated by `FeedbackCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Feedback mechanism works at each step.

Step 1. The user wishes to send a feedback in regard to the app. They execute the `feedback` command.

Step 2. The `LogicManager` receives this command string and passes it to the `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. The `AddressBookParser` identifies the type of command and invokes the relevant command, in this case, 
`FeedbackCommand`.

Step 4. This results in a `FeedbackCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.

Step 5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `LogicManager`.

Step 6. Then the `CommandResult` object will cause the `MainWindow#handleFeedback()` to be executed. 

Step 7. The `Ui` will be updated, and the success message will be displayed to the user.

Step 8. Lastly, the `Feedback` popup window will appear.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Feedback` operation works:

![FeedbackSequenceDiagram](images/FeedbackSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `Feedback` command:

![FeedbackActivityDiagram](images/FeedbackActivityDiagram.png)

#### 4.8.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect:  Storage medium for the logging of feedback received**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use Google forms to store feedback of the users.
    * Pros: Google Forms are quick and easy to set up. No need for extensive development efforts.
    * Pros: Google Forms are user-friendly, making it simple for app users to submit feedback without any technical knowledge or app-specific requirements.
    * Pros: Data Organization. Google Forms automatically organize and store feedback responses in a Google Sheets 
      spreadsheet, making it convenient for review and analysis.

    * Cons: Data Security. Storing feedback data on external platforms like Google Forms introduces security and privacy concerns.

* **Alternative 2:** Link to an online forum where users can post feedback.
    * Pros: Peer Support. In addition to providing feedback, users can help each other by sharing solutions to 
      common issues.
  
    * Cons: Lack of Control. There would be lesser control over the structure and organization of feedback compared to a 
      dedicated feedback form.

### 4.9 Theme feature

#### 4.9.1 Implementation

The add course mechanism is facilitated by `ThemeCommand`. It extends `Command` which overrides the following operation:
* `ThemeCommand#execute():` Changes the Theme of NUSCoursemates

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the theme mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The current default theme will be a light theme.

Step 2. The user executes `theme DARK` command to change the theme from light to dark.

Step 2. When `LogicManager` is called upon to execute the command, it will pass it to an `AddressBookParser` 
object which will call `parseCommand()` which creates a parser `ThemeCommandParser` and uses it to parse the command.

Step 3. This results in a `ThemeCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.

Step 4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `LogicManager`.

Step 5. The `CommandResult` object will cause `MainWindow#handleTheme()` to be executed. 

Step 6. The `Ui` will then be updated to DARK theme.

The following sequence diagram shows how the theme operation works:

![ThemeSequenceDiagram](images/ThemeSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source:**Note:**
* The lifeline for `ThemeCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
* There are other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command and can be found [here](#33-logic-component)
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `theme` command:

![ThemeActivityDiagram](images/ThemeActivityDiagram.png)

#### 4.9.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: User Interaction for Theme Change**

* **Alternative 1:** CLI Command.
    * Pros: Consistency. Aligns with the CLI nature of the application, providing a consistent interface for users accustomed to command-based interactions.
    * Pros: Efficiency. Users familiar with CLI commands can quickly change the theme without navigating through graphical menus.

    * Cons: Learning Curve. Users unfamiliar with CLI commands may face a learning curve.

* **Alternative 2:** Menu Bar Button
    * Pros: Intuitiveness. A graphical button on the menu bar may be more intuitive for users who prefer visual interactions.

    * Cons: Inconsistency. May deviate from the overall CLI theme of the application.

* **Alternative 3 (current choice):** Hybrid Approach - CLI Command and Graphical Button
    * Pros: Flexibility. Providing both options caters to a wider audience, accommodating users with different preferences.
    * Pros: User Preference. Users can choose their preferred method of interaction, enhancing the overall user experience. 
    * Pros: Discoverability. The graphical button enhances discoverability for users who might not be familiar with CLI commands.

   * Cons: Development Effort. Implementing and maintaining both CLI and graphical options may require additional development effort.

### 4.10 Course List Panel and Tag List Panel Feature

NUSCoursemates comes with three major List Panels — `PersonListPanel`, `CourseListPanel`, and `TagListPanel` as stated [above](#321-list-panel).
The three panels can be seen in the UI below:

![DGUiDiagram](images/DGUiDiagram.png)

#### 4.10.1 Implementation

The panels mechanism is facilitated by `MainWindow`. It houses the three following panels:
* `PersonListPanel`: Displays the list of all the students
* `CourseListPanel`: Displays the list of the summary of courses
* `TagListPanel`: Displays the list of the summary of tags

**Course List Panel (CourseListPanel):**

The `CourseListPanel` class is implemented as a `JavaFX` component responsible for presenting a summarised list of courses. 
It uses a `ListView` to display each course, with each item represented by a `CourseCard`. 
The `CourseCard` class encapsulates the visual representation of a course, displaying the course name 
and the number of students taking the course. The panel is dynamically updated by binding 
it to an `ObservableList<Pair<String, Integer>>`, where each pair represents the string of the course and the 
integer corresponds to number of students taking that course. The `CourseListViewCell` class which extends the `ListCell`, 
controls the rendering of each course item in the list.

**Tag List Panel (TagListPanel):**

Similar to the `CourseListPanel`, the `TagListPanel` is implemented as a `JavaFX` component utilising a `ListView` 
to display a summarised list of tags. Each tag is represented by `TagCard`. 
The panel is linked to an `ObservableList<Pair<String, Integer>>` containing tag names and number of students having the tag names, 
and the `TagListViewCell` class customises the rendering of each tag item.


#### 4.10.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: Unified Panel for Tags and Courses**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate Panels for Tags and Courses
    * Pros: Distinct Categorization. Maintaining separate panels ensures clear categorization. 
    * Pros: Focused Interaction. Users interact with tags and courses in dedicated spaces. 

    * Cons: Increased Navigation Steps. Users need to switch between panels for tags and courses, potentially adding extra steps.

* **Alternative 2:** Merge Tags and Courses into a Unified Panel
    * Pros: Simplicity. Combining tags and courses into a single panel simplifies the interface. 
    * Pros: Streamlined Navigation. Users access both tags and courses from one centralised location. 

    * Cons: Potential Information Overload.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix C: Planned Enhancements**

### C.1 Allow Duplicate Student Names
The current implementation of the Address Book in NUSCoursemates restricts users from adding multiple students who share the same name. This limitation can be problematic as it does not reflect real-world scenarios where multiple students might have identical names, hindering the user's ability to accurately manage their contacts in such cases.
   * Proposed Enhancement:
     * To improve user experience and reflect real-world scenarios more accurately, we propose an enhancement to the NUSCoursemates feature that will allow the addition of multiple students with the same name. This change will eliminate the current restriction on duplicate names, ensuring users can manage their contacts more effectively, even in cases of identical names.
   
   
   * Implementation Details:
     * Step 1: Modify the `isSamePerson` method in `Person.java` to no longer consider identical names as a criteria for duplicate entries.
     * Step 2: Adjust the logic in `UniquePersonList#setPerson()` to allow the addition of persons with duplicate names, removing the current check that prevents this.
     * Step 3: Update relevant documentation and user guides to reflect the new capability of handling duplicate names in the NUSCoursemates, ensuring users are aware of this change and can use it effectively.
   

### C.2 Do not allow duplicate Telehandles   

The current implementation of the NUSCoursemates allows for duplicate Telegram handles across contacts. This flexibility can lead to confusion and inaccuracies in managing contact information.
   * Proposed Enhancement:
     * To enhance data integrity and streamline contact management, we are planning to implement a change that enforces the uniqueness of Telegram handles within the Address Book. This improvement will prevent the inclusion of duplicate contact information, ensuring that each entry remains distinct.
   

   * Implementation Details:
     * Step 1: In the `Person.java`, we will add an additional check in the `isSamePerson` method to check whether the `Telehandle` added is equal, similar to how AB3 checks for equality of `Name`.
     * Step 2: The future implementation of the additional check for `Person#isSamePerson()` could be `otherPerson.getTelehandle().equals(getTelehandle());` <br>
     * Step 3: This would then throw a duplication error in `UniquePersonList#setPerson()` whenever it receives a duplicated `Telehandle` similar to when it receives a duplicated `Name`.


### C.3 Improve Error Messaging for 'theme' Command

Currently, our system's error message for invalid input related to the 'theme' command does not effectively communicate the nature of the error. Users may receive an error message that implies a problem with the command format, even when the issue is with the parameter itself. 
   * Proposed Enhancement:
     * To improve user understanding and minimise confusion, we plan to enhance the error message associated with the 'theme' command. Rather than attributing the error to the command format, we will explicitly communicate that the error is due to an invalid parameter and provide clear guidance on the accepted inputs. 


   * Implementation Details:
     * Step 1: In the `ThemeCommand.java`, we will include a new `INVALID_PARAMETER` message string.
     * Step 2: Afterwards, in the `ThemeCommandParser.java`, we will change the parameters of the thrown `ParseException` to the new `INVALID_PARAMETER` message string instead of the current implementation of `MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT`.


   * Possible Error Message:
   `Invalid Parameter! The error is not related to the command format but rather due to an invalid parameter. To set the theme of NUSCoursemates, please use one of the accepted options:
     'dark' for dark mode
     'light' for light mode
     Example: theme dark`

### C.4 Improve error message for commands which take in an INDEX
Currently, when an unrealistically large positive integer is entered as the `INDEX` for commands such as `delete` and `edit`, the error message displayed suggests that there is a problem with the command format even if the command format is correct. The inaccurate error message is shown because `INDEX` is too big to be parsed, resulting in an integer overflow. 
   * Proposed Enhancement:
     We plan to conduct validation checks on the positive integer input by ensuring that it is within an acceptable range imposed by us. Moreover, we will enhance the error messages returned from these features by providing clear guidance on the accepted inputs in the error message. 
   * Implementation Details:
     * Step 1: The user input is deconstructed into the various parts. 
     * Step 2: The length of `INDEX` (a string) will be determined for commands which take in an `INDEX`.  
     * Step 3: If the length of `INDEX` exceeds the length of the size of the student list, the string will not be passed into `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` for parsing. An error message will be returned, stating that the `INDEX` entered is invalid. 
     * Step 4: Otherwise, `INDEX` will be parsed and the process thereafter remains unchanged. 
     * Possible Error Message (in Step 3):
         `Invalid Parameter! The INDEX you have entered is invalid. You must only enter a positive integer after the command word that is within the size of the student list.`

### C.5 Incorporate courses from Special Terms 1 and 2 into NUSCourseMates
Currently, NUSCoursemates recognises courses from Semesters 1 and 2 only. It does not recognise courses from Special Term (ST) semesters. Therefore, users are not able to enter these ST courses into NUSCoursemates as it will deem ST courses as invalid. In addition, new courses may be rolled out throughout the semester. 
* Proposed Enhancement:
  We plan to include these ST courses in the list of valid courses. We also plan to update the list of valid courses in NUSCoursemates regularly. 
* Implementation Details:
  * We plan to update the list of valid courses throughout the semester by regularly and periodically fetching this 
  list of courses, which includes ST courses, from the NUSMods API.
  * The `CourseUtil` class would be need to be populated with new courses on a regular basis. To make this more 
    extensible and remove the need for hardcoded values, we would need to configure the app to fetch data from the NUSModsAPI instead, which is out of the scope of this course.

### C.6 Customising the sort functions
While there are various sort features implemented for users to sort NUSCoursemates, these sort features are fully pre-determined by us. Therefore, users may not be able to sort NUSCoursemates in a way they prefer. For example, for `sort tags`, students tagged as 'Close Friend' are arranged before students tagged as 'Friend' and 'Emergency'. Users are currently not able to customise this feature by changing the order. 
* Proposed Enhancement:
  We plan to allow users to customise the various sort functions to suit their preferences by introducing new parameters which increase the capabilities and versatility of these sort functions.
* Implementation Details (with reference to the `sort tags` command):
    * Step 1: The user determines the priority of tags. For example, the `Close Friend`, `Friend` and `Emergency` tags could have the priorities of 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  
    * Step 2: The user enters the priorities of these tags in order, giving rise to the `sort tags 123` command. 
    * Step 3: The command is parsed, and a priority is attached to each tag. 
    * Step 4: The students in NUSCoursemates are arranged by their highest priority tags according to the tag priorities given by the user.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix D: Effort**

Overall, we felt that the difficulty level for NUSCoursemates was moderate. When creating NUSCoursemates, which evolved from AB-3, we meticulously considered the overall design, architecture, and testing aspects to ensure the development of meaningful features for our intended users, SoC students. 

  Justification for effort: 
* **Changing existing commands** - While some commands, such as `list`, were adapted from AB-3, there were many cases where the code for these commands had to be rewritten or tweaked for NUSCoursemates. For example, the `find` feature was heavily modified and separated into new `findcourse` and `findstudent` commands.
* **Creating new classes** - We created multiple new classes (such as `course`, `tags` and `telehandle`) which are common and important attributes of our target users. 
* **Implementing new features** - We implemented new features which deal with these new classes too. The `sort` and 
  `edit c/add-` are examples. Moreover, there are validation checks for each of the new attributes. 
* **Huge improvement in UI** - With JavaFX AND FXML, we are able to create the current NUSCoursemates UI which is made up of different components and gives users the option to switch between different themes.
* ...and many more!

We faced numerous challenges in this project:
* **Learning new technologies** - Adjusting and familiarising ourselves to new technologies such as Git and GitHub were difficult for us. For example, we often made edits to the same piece of code which resulted in messy merge conflicts that took up valuable time to resolve. 
* **Time constraint** - We were also faced with tight deadlines for the various milestones and submissions. This also meant that we had to learn these new technologies in order to implement new features fast. 
* **Immediately applying what we learnt** - Juggling between the project and the concepts taught in the course was particularly difficult. For example, although heuristics for test cases were only taught towards the end of the course, we were already expected to apply them in the testing component of our project.

Achievements: 
We are definitely proud of our final product. We have picked up many invaluable soft skills (such as teamwork and collaboration) in a short amount of time, and expanded our technical proficiency in ways we had not anticipated at the project's onset.

It has been a wonderful (but really tiring) journey for all of us!
